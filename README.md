## Hello!

I go by 21bits around the internet. I've been writing code on-and-off since I discovered QBasic on an old NT workstation at age ten. A decade or two later, I've decided to get serious about my interest in software and start practicing the programming craft daily. I'm looking forward to turning the shambling piles of spaghetti I'm writing now into something new and exciting.

## My Interests

I'm trying to walk before I start running with some simple projects and contributions, but as time goes on, I'm looking to focus on:
  * Apple ecosystem apps
  * Graphics
  * Cryptography, steganography, and security
  * Audio
  * Open-source games

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm working on picking up the basics of the Swift programming language with BlueMountains, a framework for authoring old-school text adventure/interactive fiction games that run in the Mac terminal. Great for hiding on your school mainframe in 1978!
